/*
If using DP needs O(N^2).
Each time, it needs to go through previous index to see which one jump can finish game with least steps.

Greedy thought:  
Each time try to use the current range to get to the end. 
    If some index can get to the end, end the loop
    Else 
        Update the can_jump(the range) to keep trying.
    If (i >  last_arrive) means need to a new jump. 
        Update last_arrive = previous to iâ€™s max_reach.
Note:        
    Care return step+1 in return condition. 
    And the condition for the for loop.
